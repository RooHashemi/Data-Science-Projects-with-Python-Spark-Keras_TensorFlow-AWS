    "   The IMDB movie reviews dataset is a set of 50,000 reviews, half of which are positive and the other half negative. This dataset is widely used in sentiment analysis benchmarks, which makes it a convenient way to evaluate our own performance against existing models. The dataset is available online and can be either directly downloaded from Stanford’s website. \n",

    "- Load the dataset\n",
    "- Data cleaning (e.g. remove formats and punctuations)\n",

    "- Use \"Latent Dirichlet Allocation\" for document clustering (i.e. topic modeling)\n",
