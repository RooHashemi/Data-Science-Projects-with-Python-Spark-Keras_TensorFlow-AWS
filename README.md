# Data-Science-Projects-with-Python-Spark-Keras_TensorFlow-AWS
It contains a extensive range of Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects from really diverse domains.
I've categorized the projects in 6 different folders:
 1) Supervised/Unsupervised ML and Data exploration with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, etc.
 2) ML and Data Analysis with Spark
 3) Deep Learning with Keras/TensorFlow
 4) Time Series Analysis with Seasonal ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Networks
 5) NLP with Python
 6) Machine Learning on AWS Cloud, Databricks
