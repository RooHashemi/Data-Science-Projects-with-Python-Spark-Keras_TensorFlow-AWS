# Data Science Projects with Python, Spark, Keras/TensorFlow, AWS Cloud
This repository contains a extensive range of real-life Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects from diverse domains.
I've categorized the projects in 6 different folders:
 1) ML and Data Analysis in Python with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn/MatPlotLib, etc.
 2) ML and Data Analysis with Spark
 3) Deep Learning with Keras/TensorFlow
 4) Time Series Analysis with Seasonal ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Networks
 5) NLP with Python
 6) Machine Learning on AWS Cloud, Databricks

## Note: 
- The uploaded projects really cover a wide range of Data Analytics topics, from the simplest to most advanced ones, including: Data exploration/cleaning, Scalable ML, Ensemble ML models, Deep learning, Time series analysis, NLP, Recommender systems, Big data analytics, ML and data analysis on AWS cloud, and Unsupervised transformations (e.g. manifold learning).
- For every project I've put a concise data description, problem statement and workflow that describes different successive stages of corresponding data analysis pipeline. For the sake of comparison, I've tried to address a given project with different techniques (i.e. Linear Models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees or XGBoost, Stacked Models, SVMs, Deep Neural Networks, SARIMA). Next, I've thoroughly went through the detail of corresponding solutions.
