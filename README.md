# Data Science Projects with Python, Spark, Keras/TensorFlow, AWS Cloud
This repository contains a extensive range of real-life Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects from diverse domains. 100+ projects have been uploaded. I've categorized the projects in 6 different folders:
 1) ML and Data Analysis in Python with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn/MatPlotLib, etc.
 2) ML and Data Analysis with Spark (MLlib, SQL, RDDs) 
 3) Deep Learning with Keras/TensorFlow
 4) Time Series Analysis with Seasonal ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Networks
 5) NLP with Python
 6) Machine Learning on AWS Cloud, Databricks

## Note: 
- The uploaded projects cover a wide range of Data Analytics topics, from the simplest to most advanced ones, including: Data exploration/cleaning, Scalable ML, Ensemble ML models, Deep learning, Time series analysis, NLP, Recommender systems, Big data analytics, ML and data analysis on AWS cloud, and Unsupervised transformations (e.g. manifold learning).
- For every project I've put a concise data description, problem statement and workflow that describes different successive stages of corresponding data analysis pipeline. For the sake of comparison, I've tried to address a given problem with different techniques, i.e. Linear Models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees or XGBoost, Stacked Models, SVMs, Deep Neural Networks, SARIMA. 
- For a given project, I've evaluated the preformance of model by a wide range of metrics and plots. For Regression, I usually used R^2, RMSE, lift charts, distribution plot of residuals, box-plot of predictions vs. actual values. For classification problems, I've used Accuracy, ROC_AUC, F1, Confusion matrix, Average Precision, ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve. 
- Often I've used following libraries and packages:
   * Statsmodels library for statistical computations and hypothesis tests
   * imblearn library for balancing the imbalanced datasets, i.e. for re_sampling, SMOTE, random over sampling
   * Fancyimpute library for manipulation of missing values
   * SpaCy for NLP
